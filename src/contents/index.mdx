ProbML is a venue for researchers to gather and exchange ideas on the theory and practice of probabilistic machine learning and AI, especially (but not limited to) Bayesian techniques.
The Symposium on Probabilistic Machine Learning (ProbML 2026, formerly Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference) is a venue for researchers to gather and exchange ideas on the theory and practice of probabilistic machine learning and AI, especially (but not limited to) Bayesian techniques. 

ProbML will be held on July 5, 2026 in Seoul at Seoul Trade Exhibition & Convention (SETEC), co-located with ICML 2026. This year's symposium features an expanded scope with two primary areas of focus:

### Area 1: Probabilistic and/or Bayesian ML Methods

We encourage submissions that advance the foundations of probabilistic machine learning, probabilistic and (approximate) Bayesian inference, Bayesian statistics, and decision-making under uncertainty. We also welcome work exploring connections between these fields and adjacent areas such as deep learning, natural language processing, active learning, reinforcement learning, compression, AI safety, scientific computing, causal inference, foundation models, and lifelong learning.

### Area 2 (New!): Applications of Probabilistic and/or Bayesian Methods to Healthcare and Climate Change

This new focus area aims to foster stronger communication between methodology researchers and application-focused researchers. We encourage submissions that propose thoughtful, rigorous uses of probabilistic/Bayesian methods with clear empirical and scientific evidence for why the chosen methodology is well-aligned with the downstream task, particularly in data-sparse regimes, high-stakes decision making, or settings with strict interpretability, safety, or governance requirements.

We are delighted to offer three submission tracks:

- a **Proceedings Track**, for full research papers of up to 9 content pages (archival),
- a **Workshop Track**, for extended abstracts of 3-5 content pages (non-archival), and
- a **Fast Track**, for papers recently accepted at major ML venues.
