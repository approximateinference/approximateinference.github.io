In recent years, advances in probabilistic machine learning and approximate inference methods have enabled the development of state-of-the-art methods across many domains, such as in generative modeling, AI-driven scientific discovery, and AI safety, among many others.

The 7th Symposium on Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference (AABI) will be held on April 29, 2025, in Singapore, co-located with ICLR 2025.
This yearâ€™s symposium will have an expanded scope and will be focused on the development, analysis, and application of probabilistic machine learning methods broadly construed.
In line with this expanded focus, we particularly welcome submissions that explore connections between probabilistic machine learning and other fields such as deep learning, natural language processing, active learning, reinforcement learning, compression, AI safety, AI for scientific discovery, and causal inference.
We also encourage contributions that advance the foundations of probabilistic machine learning and machine learning theory.

This year we will run three submission tracks:

- a **Proceedings Track**, for full research papers of up to 12 content pages,
- a **Workshop Track**, for extended abstracts of 3-6 content pages, and
- a **Fast Track**, for recently accepted papers at selected venues.
